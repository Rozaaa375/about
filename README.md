If you find me bouncing from painting to coding to gaming, don't be alarmed. It's just my way of keeping things interesting. 

What I love: Movies from every corner of the globe, music that moves my soul, action-packed games, stunning paintings and sculptures, crafting the perfect cup of coffee and chatting with people, learning new skills, and of course, taking care of patients.

What I hate: Game glitches, kids near my computer or art supplies, dried-out paint tubes, ripped paper at the last minute, and overly sugary and milky coffees. Why choose just one when you can have them all?

I'm still learning the ropes in most of these, but I'm a quick study and always eager to try something new. 
My ultimate goals? Creating a game so addictive people will forget to eat, and becoming a cyber Frau
